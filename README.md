# Solr for newbies

The repository contains the materials for the [Solr for newbies](http://2018.code4lib.org/workshops/solr-for-newbies) workshop at Code4Lib 2018.

File **tutorial.md** has most of the material that we will cover during the workshop. In order to have a textual record of the commands to execute and their parameters all the examples in the **tutorial.md** are shown as executed via command line utilities like cURL. However, during the workshop we will use a combination of approaches, some steps will be executed through the command line while others will be done through the web admin page that Solr provides out of the box.

Files **slides.key** and **slides.pdf** are the slides with some "big picture" diagrams to support the material in tutorial.md.

File **books.json** has the sample data that we will use during the workshop.

Folder `scripts/` has a few scripts that can be used to automate the steps of adding documents or fields to the Solr core used in the tutorial. These scrips just bundle steps indicated in the tutorial.
